# Best practices to design your first API Specification

## All this information can be obtained from the [MuleSoft documentation](https://developer.mulesoft.com/tutorials-and-howtos/getting-started/best-practices-first-api-spec/).

### A brief summary:

-   **What is an API**: An API is a technology that enables applications to communicate with each other. APIs provide an easy and consistent way for developers to access data from backend systems, helping to secure the system and reduce complexity for developers who only need information from the backend.

-   **Why we need API specifications**: API specifications, written in the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) or OpenAPI Specification (OAS) format, provide specific guidelines for how the API is built and communicates, much like an assembly guide and user manual.

-   **How to create an API specification**: The first step in creating an API is to list what the API needs to do. Then, design the API with reuse in mind from the start. Outline how the API is expected to function and test it live in the browser while designing. MuleSoft products like Anypoint Design Center can be used to create and test the API specification.

-   **What components to include in the API specification**: The API specification should include the API title, the standard it will follow, the base URI, the communication protocol, resources, methods, parameters, status codes, libraries, data types, security schemas, etc. Follow API design best practices, such as using nouns instead of verbs, keeping endpoints in plural form, using the correct HTTP method, sorting, filtering, and paginating results, etc.
